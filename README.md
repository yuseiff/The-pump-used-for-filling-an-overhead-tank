# The-pump-used-for-filling-an-overhead-tank

The pump means a mechanical device using suction or pressure to raise or move liquid , compress 
gases and force air into inflatable objects such as tyres.


In the design of pumps, calculus is used to understand the flow rate of the fluid being pumped and 
the pressure required to maintain that flow. This is important for determining the size and power 
of the pump needed for a particular application. 

For example, consider a pump used for filling an overhead tank. The pump needs to be able to 
move a certain volume of fluid from the ground level to the top of the tank within a certain time 
frame. Calculus can be used to determine the flow rate and pressure required to achieve this. The 
pump must be able to generate enough pressure to overcome the resistance of the fluid as it flows 
through the pipes and up to the tank.

this applicatin is calculate the flow rate of pump by using:
-Pump Capacity 
-Pump Efficiency
-Height of the tank or vehicle being filled
-Resistance of the fluid being pumped
